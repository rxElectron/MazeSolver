üñ±Ô∏è Interactive GUI for easy maze manipulation

## Installation üíª

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/therboy/MazeSolver.git
   cd MazeSolver
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
   ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Setup for `tkinter`

You cannot install `tkinter` using `pip` because it is not available as a standalone package. Instead, it comes bundled with Python installations. Here‚Äôs how you can ensure you have it:

#### For Different Operating Systems

- **Windows:**
  Tkinter is included with the standard Python installation. If you installed Python from the official installer, you should already have it.

- **Ubuntu/Debian:**
  You can install Tkinter with:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```

- **Fedora:**
  Use the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
  ```

- **macOS:**
  Tkinter is usually included with the Python installation from python.org. If you installed Python via Homebrew, you might need to install it separately:
  ```bash
  brew install python-tk
  ```

### üß™ Verify Installation

To check if Tkinter is installed correctly, run:

```python
import tkinter
tkinter._test()
```

If a small window appears, Tkinter is working.

## Usage üöÄ

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the Maze Solver GUI, where you can create, solve, and visualize mazes.

## File Structure üìÅ

| File/Directory             | Description                                        |
